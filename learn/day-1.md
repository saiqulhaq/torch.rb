# Tensor

## What is Tensor

A tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes the concepts of scalars, vectors, and matrices. In the context of data science and machine learning, tensors are often used as a way to generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions, allowing for more complex data structures.

In simple terms:

- A 0-dimensional tensor is a scalar (a single number).
- A 1-dimensional tensor is a vector (an array of numbers).
- A 2-dimensional tensor is a matrix (a grid of numbers).
- A 3-dimensional tensor could be thought of as a cube of numbers.
- And so on for higher dimensions.

Tensors are particularly useful in fields like machine learning, neural networks, and various scientific computing tasks. They are a fundamental part of libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are widely used for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

Tensors have the following properties:

- **Order**: The number of dimensions in the tensor. Also known as rank.
- **Shape**: The size of each dimension.
- **Data type**: The type of data stored (e.g., float, int, string).

For example, you could have a 3-dimensional tensor to represent RGB values of an image. The tensor would have a shape like (height, width, 3), where height and width are the dimensions of the image, and 3 is for the RGB color channels.

Understanding how to manipulate and compute with tensors is crucial for anyone working in machine learning or data science.

## What is Numo and Numo's NArray

Numo is a ruby version of Numpy. In summary:

- **NumPy** is for Python and provides high-performance numerical operations through its `ndarray` object.
- **Numo** is the Ruby equivalent, aiming to provide similar functionalities through its NArray object.

### What is NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language that provides support for working with arrays and matrices. It offers a range of mathematical functions, random number generators, and tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and more. NumPy is the backbone of many other Python libraries, especially those used in scientific computing and data science, like SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Its primary data structure is the `ndarray`, which stands for 'n-dimensional array'.

### What is Numo
Numo (NArray) is a Ruby library for numerical computing. It is often considered the Ruby counterpart to Python's NumPy. Numo is designed for fast manipulation and computation on large datasets and provides many of the functionalities that NumPy offers, including various mathematical operations, statistical methods, and more. It stands for "NArray for Ruby," where "NArray" means N-dimensional array.

### What is Numo's Array (NArray)
NArray is the primary data structure used in Numo. Similar to NumPy's `ndarray`, the NArray object is an N-dimensional array, allowing you to perform element-wise operations, matrix manipulations, and other mathematical tasks efficiently. It is designed to hold large datasets and perform operations on them much more quickly than standard Ruby arrays.
